       "   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Be kind to others. Do not insult\n",

       "\n",

       "   from mistakes to find better solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **A simple apology can go a long way**. It can often de-escalate a situation,\n",
