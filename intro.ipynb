       "But disagreement is not an excuse for aggression: humans tend to take\n",

       "\n",
       "3. **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn\n",

       "   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Be kind to others. Do not insult\n",
       "   or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary\n",

       "6. **Moderate your expectations**. Please respect that community members choose\n",

       "   expectations is preferable to demands for another person's time.\n",
       "\n",

       "   technical, happen all the time and Jupyter is no exception.  Try to\n",
       "   understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their\n",

       "   from mistakes to find better solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **A simple apology can go a long way**. It can often de-escalate a situation,\n",
