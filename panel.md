> Jupyter provides useful tools for communicating scientific results. At its base level of reproducibility, a notebook is a single, shareable document containing a prose explanation of an idea, code for its implementation, and the output and figures illustrating the results. To accurately reproduce another researcher’s findings, a reader needs access to a similar computational environment, including the applicable data and software libraries. Binder provides a service for sharing a reproducible computational environment. For example, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration (see Figure 3) uses Binder to enable interaction with its Nobel Prize-winning research, observing gravitational waves with a single click.

> [Of software and Science. Reproducible science: what, why, and how](http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/of-software-and-science-reproducible-science-what-why-and-how.html) by [Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/about.html) provides definitions for Replicability, Reusability, and Reproducibility.  Readability refers to computational documents written for people not machines.

1. Readability
2. Reproducibility
3. Reusability

## 1. Readability

>> __Replicability__: being able to redo an experiment from scratch.
>> [_Of software and Science. Reproducible science: what, why, and how_ Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/of-software-and-science-reproducible-science-what-why-and-how.html)    
    
###  Without a human readable document, replicability would not be possible.  
## Discuss an experience where **readability & replicability** have improved the equity, education, or innovation within your team and collaborations.



---

> # 2. Reproducibility: being able to rerun an experiment as it was run, for instance by reanalysing data.

## What are your favorite ideas for making work reproducible?

### _The Hard Road to Reproducibility_ [Lorena Barba](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6308/142)

>> **Today**, a new student arriving in my group finds all of our research code in **tidy repositories**, 
>> where every change is recorded automatically. **Version control** is our **essential** technology for 
>> record keeping and collaboration. Whenever we publish a paper, we create a “reproducibility package,” 
>> deposited online, which includes the data sets and all the code that is needed to recreate the analyses
>> and figures. These are the practices that work for us as computational scientists, but the principles behind 
>> them apply regardless of discipline._

> # 3. Reusability: applying the process to a new yet similar question.
