This process is difficult under the best of circumstances; in our case, we are interested not in single objects but rather a collection of deformable objects. Motile cilia are microscopic, hair-like structures that protrude from cells and beat in synchrony to move particulates and irritants away and bring nutrients in. Cilia line the exterior of cells in nearly every part of the body; as such, diseases that affect cilia and their ability to beat properly can have myriad and severe consequences on the patient's health. To that end, studying the motion of cilia is important to better understand the pathologies of these diseases. In this talk, we'll discuss some of the basics of object segmentation, and how many of the basic assumptions are violated in circumstances such as identifying cilia in a video. We'll look at live demonstrations of alternative segmentation approaches that can be used on diffuse motion patterns such as those created by moving cilia, using Jupyter notebooks and ipywidgets to create a beginner-friendly walkthrough of the basics of ciliary motion analysis and segmentation methods.\n"

This tutorial introduces PyTorch, a Numpy-like library for deep learning that is being developed at Facebook. Along with a CPU-based NumPy back-end, PyTorch allows you to use GPU back-end without any knowledge of CUDA or other low level frameworks and languages. With PyTorch, advancing science from your web browser is fast and easy as never before! In our short tutorial we’re going to show you how to use PyTorch for regular data analytics tasks, how it’s different from Numpy, and how to train a neural network on a toy image classification dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10. Finally, we show you how we used PyTorch to solve a real problem right at the intersection of Business and Science, namely, training a classifier to determine smooth or rough surface finish in metal parts manufactured on a CNC machine, all within the comfort of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",

       "Birdsong obeys a syntax, much like speech. To study this syntax, scientists label the elements of birdsong, known as syllables, producing strings of characters that can be modeled just like any other text. One common model applied to birdsong is a first-order Markov model: essentially a transition matrix containing the probabilities of transitioning from one character to any other in a sequence. Researchers have shown that such a model cannot capture the statistics of song for some bird species. These results demonstrate long time-scale dependencies in song that first-order Markov processes cannot reproduce, and imply that the songbird brain does more than simply flip a coin as it transitions between syllables. A recent study reported that using partially-observable Markov models with adaptation (POMMA) can reproduce the statistics of label sequences for one songbird species, the Bengalese finch. In this demo,  I show how I was able to reproduce in a single Jupyter notebook the results of this study. I apply the model to two publicly-shared repositories of labeled Bengalese finch song, including one from our lab. My results confirm that the model successfully describes the syntax of many individual Bengalese finches' songs but also reveals cases where alternative models may be a better fit. I present these results as a case study in reproducibility, to show how Jupyter can drive research forward by allowing editors, reviewers, and readers to interact with the results presented in any scientific study.\n",

Along the way, they received aid, trade, and shelter from the folk who called this wilderness home. The Corps of Discovery returned with notebooks full of geographic, scientific, and cultural data. The journey to Jupyter started with 259 lines of Python in 2001... and is hardly over yet! In this talk, we'll map the code and community that supports IPython, the Notebook, and the upcoming JupyterLab, and look at some of the discoveries along the way.\n"
